# xyz_gen

`xyz_gen` is a Dart package designed to generate boilerplate code, reducing the amount of repetitive code you need to write.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  xyz_gen: any
```

2. Download the generator scripts here https://github.com/robmllze/xyz_gen/blob/main/___generators.zip and extract them to your project's root directory.

3. Modify the generators as needed. You may also wish to change the generator templates to suit your needs.

4. If you're using VS Code, you can right-click one of the generators, such as `generate_exports.dart`, and select "Run Code".

5. If you're using another IDE, you can run the generators from the command line, e.g. `dart generate_exports.dart`.
